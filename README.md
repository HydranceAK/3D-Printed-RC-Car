**Materials \& Printing Notes**





TPU recommended for flexible and shock-absorption components



PETG recommended for strength, heat resistance, and rigidity



Everything can be printed on Bambu Lab a1 (0.4 or 0.6 nozzle)



Hardware, electronics, and drivetrain components sourced Amazon and AliExpress
