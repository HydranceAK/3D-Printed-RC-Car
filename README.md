**3D Printed RC Car**

A high-performance, fully custom 3D-printed RC car.



Designed and engineered by ***Hydrance***.





**Features**





* 4WD Drivetrain – Enhanced traction and stability.



* Top Speed: ~60 km/h – High-speed performance



* 90% 3D-Printed Build



* Independent Suspension 



* Durable Materials



* TPU parts for flexible components (tires, dampening mounts, impact zones)



* PETG parts for strong structural elements (chassis, arms, mounts)


* PA6-CF highly recommended but not nessecary for gears and bottom suspension arms. These peices undergo extreme stress and may break if you drive rough.  



* Affordable Build – Total estimated cost ~$330 (without screws \& filament $270)







**Materials \& Printing Notes**





TPU recommended for flexible and shock-absorption components



PETG recommended for strength, heat resistance, and rigidity



Everything can be printed on Bambu Lab a1 (0.4 or 0.6 nozzle)



Hardware, electronics, and drivetrain components sourced Amazon and AliExpress
